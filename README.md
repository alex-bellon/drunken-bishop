# Drunken Bishop

My Python implementation of the drunken bishop algorithm used to generate the ASCII art that you see when using OpenSSH. I created my implementation by following the algorithm outlined in [this](http://www.dirk-loss.de/sshvis/drunken_bishop.pdf) whitepaper.

## Usage

```shell
python drunken_bishop.py
```

You will then be asked to input your fingerprint (in the form `xx:xx:xx...` where `x` is a hex number).
